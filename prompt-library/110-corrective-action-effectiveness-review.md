Use only the supplied, current, approved sources.
Required inputs:
- approved CAPA plan
- root-cause record
- implementation evidence
- follow-up audit/inspection data
- repeat incidents/findings
- closure authority

For each source, record title/system, revision or extraction date, owner and scope.
If an essential source is missing, stale, contradictory or unverified, place it in an EVIDENCE GAP section. Do not fill the gap from general knowledge.
Official/regulatory/classification requirements must come from the current official source supplied or verified by the authorized human reviewer.

E — EXPECTED OUTPUT, EXCEPTIONS & EVIDENCE
Return:
- implementation verification
- effectiveness evidence
- recurrence check
- residual risk
- additional action needs
- closure recommendation for human approver

Separate the response into:
1. CONFIRMED FACTS
2. AUDIT CRITERIA / REQUIREMENTS
3. OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE
4. AUDITOR JUDGMENT / PROPOSED FINDINGS
5. ASSUMPTIONS OR HYPOTHESES
6. EVIDENCE GAPS / CONTRADICTIONS
7. RECOMMENDED FOLLOW-UP
8. HUMAN DECISIONS REQUIRED

When using a sample, state the sample size and do not generalize beyond what the evidence supports.
When comparing periods, show the denominator and definition before claiming improvement or deterioration.

QUALITY-AUDIT CONTROL
For every proposed finding, show: CRITERION / OBSERVATION / OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE / GAP / EVIDENCE STATUS.
Do not invent evidence. Do not assign blame. Do not present a root-cause hypothesis as validated. Do not declare a finding or CAPA closed unless the authorized human owner confirms closure through the approved workflow.

L — LIMITS, PRIVACY & LEADERSHIP APPROVAL
Do not independently determine regulatory compliance, legal liability, employee misconduct, disciplinary action, guest compensation, safety clearance, financial approval or final CAPA closure.
Do not expose unnecessary guest identity data, employee personal data, payment information, credentials, security-sensitive details or confidential contracts.
Escalate safety, fire/life-safety, security, privacy, discrimination, legal, medical, food-safety, water-hygiene or other specialist findings to the qualified role defined by policy.
The output remains a draft until the accountable human auditor/owner verifies the evidence, applies professional judgment and authorizes the next action.
```

### Human verification checklist

- Is the criterion current and controlled?
- Is the evidence traceable to the sample?
- Does the conclusion stay within the evidence?
- Are severity and authority based on approved rules?
- Are missing or contradictory records visible?
- Is personal/confidential data minimized?
- Has the authorized quality owner reviewed the output?
